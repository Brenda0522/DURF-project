In this research, we looked for a relationship between China’s birth rate and its aggregate production.

We collected data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which conducts a population census every ten years since 1950, which includes data on annual productivity surveys, labor force, average salary, etc. We did data processing and had the final dataset Panel.csv.

Modeling was performed using R in the durf.Rmd file.

The DURF_Report pdf is the report we drafted.
